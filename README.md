888# BallBall CS (球球 CS)

I remember I played a small game in 2008. It is somewhat similar to CS but in tow down view.

The character you control is a ball. It is a multiplayer online game and you can shoot each other.

I can't seem to find this game now, and I don't remember the name. Anyway, I'll try to create a similar game.

# Game Description

BallBall CS is an exhilarating 2D top-down perspective game inspired by Counter-Strike (CS) but with a unique twist. In this game, players take control of ball characters. The minimalist yet visually engaging design enhances the focus on intense gameplay and tactical decision-making.
